# 📊 STAT481 – Data Mining Project

This project was completed as part of the STAT481: Fundamentals of Data Mining course at the University of Bahrain.  
It documents the data mining techniques and insights derived from financial and retail datasets.

## 👥 Team
- **Ebrahim Juma Alsawan **  
- **Ali Sameer**

## 🎯 Objective
To apply classification, clustering, and association rule mining techniques in real-world scenarios and evaluate their performance.

## 🛠 Techniques Used
- **Classification**:  
  Built Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict loan approvals. Achieved **92.56% accuracy** and **AUC = 0.97**.

- **Clustering**:  
  Performed Hierarchical Clustering using different linkage methods (Single, Complete, Ward) to segment customer data.

- **Association Rule Mining**:  
  Identified strong purchasing patterns in transaction data to optimize product placement and bundling.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Important loan approval factors: credit score, interest rate, and income-to-loan ratio.
- Frequent itemsets in retail data included bakery, juice, and dairy products.
- Different clustering methods result in significantly different customer groupings.
